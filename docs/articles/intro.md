# Overview

### Install
Create new console application and install the [MatrixDotNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MatrixDotNet/) NuGet package. We support:

* Projects: classic and modern with PackageReferences
* Runtimes: .NETStandard 2.1, NET Core 3.1+
* OS: Windows, Linux, MacOS

### Matrix

There are many ways creates of matrix so let's consider the following sample how to create Matrix.   

[!code-csharp[CreateMatrixSample.cs](../../samples/Samples/logs/MatrixCreateSample/MatrixCreateSampleDocs.cs)]

As you can see class `Matrix` can assign any type implicit such as one, two dimensional and jugged array.
Matrix stores your data in one dimensional array, you can get with happen method `GetArray()`.

##### Output 

[!code-csharp[Run](../../samples/Samples/logs/MatrixCreateSample/Run.txt)]

#### Simple operations of matrix.

So, as we know how to create matrix let's to try make routine operations with matrix.  

[!code-csharp[CreateMatrixSampleDocs.cs](../../samples/Samples/logs/SimpleOperations/SimpleOperationsDocs.cs)]

> [CreateMatrixSample.cs](https://github.com/toor1245/MatrixDotNet/blob/master/samples/Samples/Samples/MatrixSamples/SimpleOperations.cs)

As you can see thanks overload operators, it's possible write less code and becomes more readable.   

##### Output

[!code-csharp[Run](../../samples/Samples/logs/SimpleOperations/Run.txt)]

### Vector

The next structure is Vector.

Let's consider the following sample which demonstrates how to create vector.

[!code-csharp[VectorSimpleOperationsDocs.cs](../../samples/Samples/logs/CreateVectorSample/CreateVectorSampleDocs.cs)]

> [SimpleOperations.cs](https://github.com/toor1245/MatrixDotNet/blob/master/samples/Samples/Samples/VectorSamples/CreateVectorSample.cs)

##### Output

[!code-csharp[Run](../../samples/Samples/logs/CreateVectorSample/Run.txt)]

#### Routine operations with `Vector`

So let's consider `Vector` operations as well as in `Matrix`
 
[!code-csharp[VectorSimpleOperationsDocs.cs](../../samples/Samples/logs/VectorSimpleOperations/VectorSimpleOperationsDocs.cs)]
 
> [SimpleOperations.cs](https://github.com/toor1245/MatrixDotNet/blob/master/samples/Samples/Samples/VectorSamples/VectorSimpleOperations.cs)

##### Output
[!code-csharp[Run](../../samples/Samples/logs/CreateVectorSample/Run.txt)]

### MatrixComplex

The last structure and the newest is `MatrixComplex`, for now MatrixComplex in difference from `Matrix` and `Vector` have only fundamental operations.
MatrixComplex still in development stage.

Take a look below on sample.

[!code-csharp[CreateMatrixComplexDocs.cs](../../samples/Samples/logs/CreateMatrixComplex/CreateMatrixComplexDocs.cs)]
 
> [CreateMatrixComplex.cs](https://github.com/toor1245/MatrixDotNet/blob/master/samples/Samples/Samples/MatrixComplexSamples/CreateMatrixComplex.cs)

##### Output
[!code-csharp[Run](../../samples/Samples/logs/CreateMatrixComplex/Run.txt)]
