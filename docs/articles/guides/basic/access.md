# Access to matrix elements overview.
 
There are many approaches in Matrix DotNet receive element or vector of matrix.
So let's consider how we can to get element of matrix.

[!code-csharp[AccessToElements.cs](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/AccessToElements/AccessToElementsDocs.cs)]

#### Output

[!code-csharp[Run](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/AccessToElements/Run.txt)]

As you can see the are difference ways to access of matrix and no difference in performance.
you can use way which you have more prefer.

Also, you can get `Vector` of matrix by row or column, take a look on below code. 
[!code-csharp[AccessToVector.cs](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/AccessToVector/AccessToVectorDocs.cs)]
Thus, the same like in access of element can gets vector. 

#### Output
[!code-csharp[Run](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/AccessToVector/Run.txt)]
