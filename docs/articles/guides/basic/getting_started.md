# Getting started

In this Basic section of Guides we will cover all general operations with matrix.

### Matrix

There are many ways creates of matrix so let's consider the following sample how to create Matrix.   

[!code-csharp[CreateMatrixSample.cs](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/MatrixCreateSample/MatrixCreateSampleDocs.cs)]

As you can see class `Matrix` can assign any type implicit such as one, two dimensional and jugged array.
Matrix stores your data in one dimensional array, you can get with happen method `GetArray()`.

##### Output 

[!code-csharp[Run](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/MatrixCreateSample/Run.txt)]

#### Simple operations of matrix.

So, as we know how to create matrix let's to try make routine operations with matrix.  

[!code-csharp[CreateMatrixSampleDocs.cs](../../../../samples/Samples/logs/SimpleOperations/SimpleOperationsDocs.cs)]

As you can see thanks overload operators, it's possible write less code and becomes more readable.
